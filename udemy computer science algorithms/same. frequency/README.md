# Same Frequency

## Task Overview
Write a function called sameFrequency. Given two positive integers, find out if the two numbers have the same frequency of digits.
Your solution MUST have the following complexities: Time: O(N)

## Possible Logic
I think maybe using a multiple pointer approach will allow for me to keep the time complexity down while also keeping a counter going for each number to determine if they are equal or not therefore determining a true or false value.
