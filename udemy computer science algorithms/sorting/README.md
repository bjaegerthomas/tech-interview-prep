# Bubble Sort

## Task Overview
Create a function which takes in an array of integers and sorts them in ascending order using the bubble sort methodology, returning the final sorted array.

## Possible Logic
Start looping with variable i from the end of the array to the beginning. Then start an inner loop with a variable j from the beginning to i - 1. If arr[j] is greater than arr[j+1] then swap those two values. Finally return the sorted array.
