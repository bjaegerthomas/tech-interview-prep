# Selection Sort

## Task Overview
Create a function which accepts an array and sorts those values from lowest to highest by comparing adjacent elements one at a time to find the current minimum value and once it loops through the array, swaps the inital index with the minimum value. Then the process repeats until the inputed array is sorted.
