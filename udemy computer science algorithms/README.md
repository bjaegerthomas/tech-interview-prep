# Homework 2 - Anagram Problem

## Task Overview
Given two strings, write a function which determines if the first string is an anagram of the second.

## Possible Logic
Break each entry into an object with the split method. Iterate with a for loop checking each object against the other and popping values out of both when there is a match. At the end check with an if statement if both objects are empty inwhich case, they are an anagram, else they are not.
