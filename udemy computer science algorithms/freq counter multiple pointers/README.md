# Are There Duplicates - Frequency Counter with multiple pointers

## Task Overview
Implement a function called, areThereDuplicates which accepts a variable number of arguments, and checks whether there are any duplicates among the arguments passed in.  You can solve this using the frequency counter pattern OR the multiple pointers pattern.

## Possible Logic
I want to attempt the multiple pointers pattern. Honestly I think using a sliding window approach might get us closer to lgo(n) time complexity.
