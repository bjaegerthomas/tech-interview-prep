# Trees

Consist of nodes like a singly or doubly linked list but they are in a parent-child relationship. The connections branch out from individual nodes and can then have branches out from each of those branched nodes as well.

The very first node is called the root.

Trees are non-linear.

A node can only point to a child, it can't point to other parent nodes. In addition there can not be more than one root.

Root - the top node in a tree
Child - a node directly connected to another node when moving away from the root
Parent - the converse notion of a child
Siblings - a group of nodes with the same parent
Leaf - is a node with no children
Edge - connection between one node and another

# Uses

HTML DOM
Network Routing
Abstract Syntax Trees - a way of describing the syntax of a programming language using a tree structure
Artificial Intelligence
Folders in Operating Systems
Computer file systems
Json Objects

# Kinds

Binary Trees - Each node can have at most, two children.
Binary Search Trees - Are sorted in a particular way where you can order it and compare nodes. Every child node to the left of the parent node is less than the parent node in value and every child node to the right of the parent node is greater in value.
