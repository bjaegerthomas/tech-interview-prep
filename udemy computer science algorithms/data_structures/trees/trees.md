# Trees

Consist of nodes like a singly or doubly linked list but they are in a parent-child relationship. The connections branch out from individual nodes and can then have branches out from each of those branched nodes as well.

The very first node is called the root.

Trees are non-linear.

A node can only point to a child, it can't point to other parent nodes. In addition there can not be more than one root.

Root - the top node in a tree
Child - a node directly connected to another node when moving away from the root
Parent - the converse notion of a child
Siblings - a group of nodes with the same parent
Leaf - is a node with no children
Edge - connection between one node and another
