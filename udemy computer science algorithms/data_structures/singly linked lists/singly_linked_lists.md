# Singly Linked Lists

## Linked List

A data structure that contains a head, tail and length
property.

Linked Lists consist of nodes, and each node has a value
and a pointer to another node or null

Comparisons with Arrays

Lists

Do not have indexes!
Connected via nodes with a next pointer
Random access is not allowed

Arrays

Indexed in order!
Insertion and deletion can be expensive
Can quickly be accessed at a specific index

Singly linked lists are an excellent alternative to arrays when insertion and deletion at the beginning are fequently required.

Arrays contain a built in index where as Linked Lists do not.

The idea of a list data structure that consists of nodes is the foundation for other data structures like Stacks and Queues.
