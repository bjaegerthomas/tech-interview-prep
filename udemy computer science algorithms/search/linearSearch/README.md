# Linear Search

## Task Overview
Write a function called linearSearch which accepts an array and a value, and returns the index at which the value exists. If the value does not exist in the array, return -1.

Don't use indexOf to implement this function!

## Possible Logic
I can create a for loop to loop through every element in the array and check it against the inputed value.
