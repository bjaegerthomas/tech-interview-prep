# Product of Array

## Task Overview
Write a function called productOfArray which takes in an array of numbers and returns the product of them all.

## Possible Logic
This should be similar to a factorial style recursion problem except I will have to implement the indexes of an object which I convert from the array of values given as an argument. This way, the argument for the recursive call would be the objects key, incremented by 1 each time through until the length of the object has been met. This may actually require a for loop so i can use the counter as my index value.

*UPDATE* Not sure I need to change the array into an object.
