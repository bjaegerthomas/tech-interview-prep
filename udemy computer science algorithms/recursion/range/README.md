# Range

## Task Overview
Write a function called recursiveRange which accepts a number and adds up all the numbers from 0 to the number passed to the function.

## Possible Logic
This should work very much like the power and product of array problems. I just need to figure out what the base case is to break the cycle. The function will accept a number. The base case being if the num = 0 then I would return 0 ending the loop. The argument inside the recursive function call should be num -1.
