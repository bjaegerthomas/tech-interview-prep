# Recursion

Recursion is a process(function) that calls itself.
You invoke the same function with a different input until you reach the base case.

# Call Stack
The call stack, determines the order within which functions are called.
When a function is invoked, it is placed at the top of the call stack.
when the function ends or keyword return is hit. The function is removed from the top of the stack.

# Base Case
The condition where the recursion ends.
