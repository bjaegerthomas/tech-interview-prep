    function majorityElement(nums) {
        let count = 0;         // Counter for tracking candidate support
        let candidate = null;  // Current majority candidate

        for (let num of nums) {
            if (count === 0) {
                candidate = num;  // Set new candidate
            }
            count += (num === candidate) ? 1 : -1; // Vote for or against
        }

        return candidate;
    }

    ðŸ’¡ How it works:
    
    count === 0: Youâ€™re allowed to change your vote to a new candidate.

    num === candidate: We reinforce our belief this is the majority.

    num !== candidate: We reduce confidence â€” maybe it's not the majority.

    Eventually, the majority element will outweigh all others combined, so it wins.
