# Palindrome

## Task Overview
Given an integer x, return true if x is a palindrome, and false otherwise.

Example 1:

Input: x = 121
Output: true
Explanation: 121 reads as 121 from left to right and from right to left.
Example 2:

Input: x = -121
Output: false
Explanation: From left to right, it reads -121. From right to left, it becomes 121-. Therefore it is not a palindrome.
Example 3:

Input: x = 10
Output: false
Explanation: Reads 01 from right to left. Therefore it is not a palindrome.
 

Constraints:

-231 <= x <= 231 - 1

## Approach
// Create a function nmed palindrome which accepts an integer
    // initialize variable right for right side of integer to 0
    // for loop which runs through length of integer - 1 where i starts at x - 1 and decrements every pass
        // check if right and i !==
        // if true return false
    // return true if the integer is a palindrome and exits the for loop
