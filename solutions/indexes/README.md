# Character Frequency

## Problem

Write a function that takes a string of lowercase characters and returns an object where the keys are the characters and the values are the number of times each character appears.

## Solution Approach

1. Maintain the approach in the previous solution of a frequency counter but implement the addition of a string input. Incorporate the split function to
divide the intital input into a new object with various keys represented by individual letters then use the frequency algorithm to count each one.
2. Time Complexity:
3. Space Complexity:
