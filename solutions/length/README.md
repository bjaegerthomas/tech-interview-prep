# Length of Words

## Problem

Write a function that takes an array of words and returns an object where each word is a key and its value is the length of that word.

## Solution Approach

1. Building off of the previous exercises, creating a for loop that iterates over the inputed string, breaks them apart based on spaces between words, and then uses length function to determine length of each word before storing results in a new object.
2. Time Complexity: O(n)
3. Space Complexity:O(n)
