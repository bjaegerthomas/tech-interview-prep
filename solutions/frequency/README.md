# Count Occurrences of Numbers

## Problem

Write a function that takes an array of numbers and returns an object that counts how often each number appears in the array.

## Solution Approach

1. Set up a for loop to iterate over the array of numbers. Create a count for each number through a separate object.
2. Time Complexity: O(n)
3. Space Complexity: O(n)
