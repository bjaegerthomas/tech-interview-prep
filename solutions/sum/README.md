# Sum of Even and Odd Numbers

## Problem

Write a function that takes an array of numbers and returns an object with two properties: even and odd, representing the sum of all even numbers and all odd numbers respectively.

## Solution Approach

1. Iterate over the array to determine if a value is odd or even before using the sum function to store the total value of each in a variable for each element (odd or even). Return an object with both variables stored as keys and values.
2. Time Complexity: O(n)
3. Space Complexity: O(n)
