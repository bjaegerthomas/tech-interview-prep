# Homework 2 - Tech Interview Review and Leet Code

## Task Overview

1) Review Tech interview questions. Asking each question to yourself again and then answering them out loud. Take into account questions you struggled on or got wrong after comparing answers to the correct ones provided. Make note of why you struggled or skipped certain questions.

2) Tackle the first Leetcode problem Majority Element. The majority element is the element that appears more than ⌊n / 2⌋ times. You may assume that the majority element always exists in the array. Given an array nums of size n, return the majority element. Take 40 mins on the assignement, after which, get an answer from AI along with a high level breakdown of the solution as well as a low level breakdown. Record your struggles with the task.

## Goals
Strengthen tech interview skills and understanding of basic web development principles and terms. Strengthen problem solving abilities with an example function test and breakdown my logic behind arriving at the solution. Work on coding protocol for both solving a problem as well as minimizing time and space complexity.

## Tech Interview Recap self-evaluation

1. == vs. === - Medium Confident - could have used more technical specificty
2. Box model in CSS - Hesitant at first, Confident answer - better example
3. Flexbox/Responsive Design - Confident - Could be more concise and tight
4. DOM - Skipped
5. Git in version control - Hesitant, but Confident answer
6. Typescript in React component - example - Medium Confidence - need a better example
7. function of fetch() in Restful API - Confident - could use a more technical answer
8. ORM in database management - Skipped - need to revisit definition and terms
9. create and manage environment variables - Confident - could use the dotenv portion for creation
10. SQL joins - Skipped - need to revisit terms and syntax
11. Difference between left and inner join SQL - Skipped - not sure of syntax and terms
12. Role of data visualization and data analysis with Python and two popular libraries - Missed this one - ultimately i would have skipped it because i didn't know the libraries or answer.
13. Restful API and how does it interact with JS - Confident answer - I talked about CRUD but could use a more overall definition in terms of how it interacts
14. TDD - Skipped - this was a simple one but I think i need to revisit the term
15. CI/CD - Confident answer - might be slightly off in my overall answer and could use a more streamlined definition
16. Full stack application to the cloud - missed this one as well - would have answered confidently but would have missed the CI/CD portion of this response and would have offered render as opposed to AWS
17. AI tools copilot - Confident answer - full and robust answer with additional examples
18. Main principles of Object Oriented Programming - skipped - I remember the answer from Seif's mock interview after reading but need to memorize a more concise answer for myself.
19. React lifecycle and useEffect - skipped - need to revisit this definition
20. Explain a restful API using express, middleware, and routing - skipped - need to go over syntax and definitions
