# Homework 2 - Tech Interview Review and Leet Code

## Task Overview

1) Review Tech interview questions. Asking each question to yourself again and then answering them out loud. Take into account questions you struggled on or got wrong after comparing answers to the correct ones provided. Make note of why you struggled or skipped certain questions.

2) Tackle the first Leetcode problem Majority Element. The majority element is the element that appears more than ⌊n / 2⌋ times. You may assume that the majority element always exists in the array. Given an array nums of size n, return the majority element. Take 40 mins on the assignement, after which, get an answer from AI along with a high level breakdown of the solution as well as a low level breakdown. Record your struggles with the task.

## Goals
Strengthen tech interview skills and understanding of basic web development principles and terms. Strengthen problem solving abilities with an example function test and breakdown my logic behind arriving at the solution. Work on coding protocol for both solving a problem as well as minimizing time and space complexity.
