# Homework 2 - Basic Repo Set-up and Big Project Idea

## Task Overview
Set up the basic tree structure for this tech interview prep repo. Also start to think of big project ideas to work on with Seif as part of this mentorship program

## Goals
Set-up the structure for this repo along with folder and file naming conventions that help organize all of the tasks during this coaching program. In addition, begin brainstorming ideas for a big project to be completed later in the course.

## Ideas
One idea I had was for an application which helps the common person navigate the health system and choose the best health insurance for themselves by comparing and contrasting many different quotes as well as rating things like their claims process, premiums, co-pays, and out-of-pocket max as well as in-network deductible threshholds.

I think a MERN stack would work well for compiling this information.
